<h2>About Me:</h2>

I am pursuing an Integrated Master of Mechanical Engineering degree with an Industrial Year, at the University of Birmingham, expected to graduate in June 2026.
Throughout my course I garnered a passion for designing, manufacturing and optimizing, both safely and sustainably, I aim to apply my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on society. 
Having spent over a year in industry in both the public sector (in product safety) and private sector (in engineering project management), assures me that I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to a team in the engineering industry.
